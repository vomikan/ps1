# ps1
PowerShell script

This script automates the process of sorting image files within zip archives. It scans a specified folder for zip files, extracts them to a temporary folder, filters and moves only ".png" and ".jpg" files to specific folders within the zip archive based on file names, and then compresses the sorted files back into a new zip archive with a "Sorted_" prefix. Finally, it cleans up the temporary folders created during processing.
